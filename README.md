# AIs-on-Win-C-Python
Make Win+C useful again, make it open AIs.

To make it work, "compile" it into .exe (or download the one I made) and put it in autostart folder.

Once it detects that you pressed Win+C, it kills Cortana and opens ChatGPT and DuckDuckGo AIs in your default web browser.

Made for Windows 10, on Windows 11 you may need to remove waiting for Cortana.exe to open.
